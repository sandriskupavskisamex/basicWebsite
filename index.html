            <p>As a back-end engineer working at American Express, most of my experience is held in building out
                financially-themed microservices. I am proficient in Java and comfortable with in-demand tools
                such as Spring and Kafka. <br>Outside of the 9-5, I also enjoy working on the front-end side of things.
                I have worked with JavaScript, frameworks such as jQuery and database management systems such as
                MySQL, providing me with the knowledge to be capable of creating full-stack applications.</p>

            <p>I'm a passionate and an ambitious individual... but who isn't? Boring. Sports are at the core of my heart, with basketball being right in the middle of it. Love watching it, love playing it, love talking about it.
                Aside from that, I have an "artsy" side to me which I fulfill with music and express by playing instruments, writing my own music and singing.</p>
